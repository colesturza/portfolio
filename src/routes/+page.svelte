        My name is Cole Sturza. I am currently a Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin Space. Presently, I work on a team
        that primarily focuses on creating communications simulation software.

      <p>
        Before working at Lockheed, I received my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science at the University
        of Colorado Boulder in 2022 and 2021, respectively. I graduated with a minor in Applied Mathematics and summa
        cum laude honors in my undergraduate degree. I focused primarily on courses related to the intelligent systems
        sub-plan in my graduate degree.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professionally, my interests are backend software development, DevOps, AI, machine learning, natural language
        processing, deep learning, and operations research (also known as convex optimization). I typically enjoy topics
        focused on math, computer science, engineering, economics, and political science (particularly computational
        social choice, political economy, and urban planning). I do also dable in frontend development occasionally.

        I also enjoy playing soccer, skiing/snowboarding, cooking, listening to music, traveling, and playing video
        games in my free time.
